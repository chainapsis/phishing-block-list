# Phishing Block List
The `block-list.txt` file contains known phishing websites. It is used, for example, in the Keplr Wallet extension to alert users when they visit one of these sites.

## Policy
The list is mainly focused on websites connected to cryptocurrency phishing/malware. Each report is evaluated on a case by case basis. 

## Reporting
To report a website you can open a issue on this repository and we will review the website. Otherwise you can also use https://cosmoshield.org/app/dashboard to report websites.
Reports to cosmoshield are synced with this repository once a day. 

## Injustified blocking
Please open an issue if you believe a/your website is blocked without being fraudulent.
